## Usage

This package provides the `@stable` macro
to enforce that functions have type stable return values.

```julia
using DispatchDoctor: @stable

@stable function relu(x)
    if x > 0
        return x
    else
        return 0.0
    end
end
```

Calling this function will throw an error for any type instability:

```julia
julia> relu(1.0)
1.0

julia> relu(0)
ERROR: TypeInstabilityError: Instability detected in function `relu`
with arguments `(Int64,)`. Inferred to be `Union{Float64, Int64}`,
which is not a concrete type.
```

Code which is type stable should safely compile away the check:

```julia
julia> @stable f(x) = x;
```

with `@code_llvm f(1)`:

```llvm
define i64 @julia_f_12055(i64 signext %"x::Int64") #0 {
top:
  ret i64 %"x::Int64"
}
```

Meaning there is zero overhead on this type stability check.

You can also use `@stable` on blocks of code,
including `begin-end` blocks, `module`, and anonymous functions.
The inverse of `@stable` is `@unstable` which turns it off:

```julia
@stable begin

    f() = rand(Bool) ? 0 : 1.0
    f(x) = x

    module A
        # Will apply to code inside modules:
        g(; a, b) = a + b

        # Will recursively apply to included files:
        include("myfile.jl")

        module B
            # as well as nested submodules!

            # `@unstable` inverts `@stable`:
            using DispatchDoctor: @unstable
            @unstable h() = rand(Bool) ? 0 : 1.0

            # This can also apply to code blocks:
            @unstable begin
                h(x::Int) = rand(Bool) ? 0 : 1.0
                # ^ And target specific methods
            end
        end
    end
end
```

All methods in the block will be wrapped with the type stability check:

```julia
julia> f()
ERROR: TypeInstabilityError: Instability detected in function `f`.
Inferred to be `Union{Float64, Int64}`, which is not a concrete type.
```

(*Tip: in the REPL, you must wrap modules with `@eval`, because the REPL has special handling of the `module` keyword.*)

You can globally disable stability errors with the `allow_unstable` context:

```julia
julia> @stable f(x) = x > 0 ? x : 0.0

julia> allow_unstable() do
           f(1)
       end
1
```

Instability errors are also skipped during precompilation.
